# Split Snippet Transform - A Visual Studio Code extension

This is just a small plugin mainly for my personal use.

It allowes me to apply some kind of snippet-like template to structured data, effectively giving the opportunity of filling multiple values at predifend places in a text.

# Features

This is work in progress. At some point it should have about the same functionality as my Sublime Text 3 plugin
